== Running the sample

1. https://consul.io/downloads.html[Install consul]
2. Run `./run_consul.sh` found in the root of this project
3. verify consul is running by visiting http://localhost:8500
4. run `mvn --settings .settings.xml package` this will bring in the required spring cloud maven repositories and build
5. run `java -jar spring-cloud-consul-sample/target/spring-cloud-consul-sample-1.0.0.BUILD-SNAPSHOT.jar`
6. visit http://localhost:8080, verify that `{"serviceId":"<yourhost>:8080","host":"<yourhost>","port":8080}` results
7. run `java -jar spring-cloud-consul-sample/target/spring-cloud-consul-sample-1.0.0.BUILD-SNAPSHOT.jar --server.port=8081`
8. visit http://localhost:8080 again, verify that `{"serviceId":"<yourhost>:8081","host":"<yourhost>","port":8081}` eventually shows up in the results in a round robbin fashion (may take a minute or so).
